# HappyCampers

```
Description:

Happy Campers is a front end responsive app that lets a user search for national park camp sites. Once they pick a location, it will give them the current weather conditions.

Users can search for national parks by name or letter. 
After results load, the user can then pick a camp location based on pictures. 
Clicking on a campsite then gives a description and the weather.
If they decide on a specific park, there is also a link that will take them directly to the camp's website to book.
